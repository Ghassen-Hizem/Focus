## Description : 
This is a web extension developed by me , it's a personal project that i created for the purpose of learning and to avoid the distraction of social media when working ,
it's a simple extension with a running javaScript background code , that contains a countdown and a redirection logic whenever i try to distract myself from working by opening social media tabs 

## Details : 

- This project contains an index.html with inline css using bootstrap 5 , it contains minimal css and a simple page because it's more about the idea and the logic than the UI
- a manifest.json v2
- a background.js file that contains the redirection logic
